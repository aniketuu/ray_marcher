# ray_marcher

This is a computer graphics project based upon ray marching rendering algorithm.

A couple of months ago, I saw a Code Parade video about ray marching and that got me interested ( his video is waaay cooler than mine, I just stopped at basic fractals ). Inigo Quilez's website was a great resource for learning about ray marching checkout his website too.
